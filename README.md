# DeepCovid Dataset and Implementation in PyTorch

Here we provide the PyTorch implementation of the DeepCovid Framework (the training and inference code) for the research community to use.



## COVID-XRay-5K DATASET
We prepared a dataset of around 5000 images, which can be downloaded from here: [dataset_link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mzas2tkd80pubh7/data_covid5k.zip?dl=0)

Two sources are used to create this dataset:
* [Covid-Chestxray-Dataset](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset), for COVID-19 X-ray samples
* [ChexPert Dataset](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/), for Non-COVID samples

COVID-19 samples from Covid-Chestxray-Dataset are extracted from a several publications, and it is important to verify all their labels. With the help of a board-certified radiologist, we went through X-ray images of COVID-19 samples, and only kept those which were selceted to have a clear sign of COVID-19 by our radiologist. We also only kept the posterior-anterior images. 

For Non-COVID samples, we tried to uniformly sample images from ChexPert. More details on the dataset are provided in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09363.pdf).

As the number of COVID-19 samples are much fewer than the number of Non-COVID samples, we used several data-augmentation techniques (as well as over-sampling) to increase the number of COVID-19 samples in training, to have a less imbalanced training set. Hopefully more cleanly labeled X-ray images from COVID-19 cases become available soon, so we do not have this imbalanced data issue.

# Training a model
We have provided a Python script to train a ResNet18 model on the training data. 
The training script gets a few arguments from the user, such as the training data path, leanring rate, number of epochs, etc. There is a default value for all of these arguments, but if you can specify your own argument too. 
You can run the training code as:

python ResNet18_train.py --dataset_path ./data/ --batch_size 20 --epoch 50 --num_workers 4 --learning_rate 0.001 --momentum 0.5

Note that if you are running this on Windows, you need to set the num_workers to 0, as PyTorch support on Windows is still limited.
